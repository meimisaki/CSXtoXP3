# Yosuga no Sora Patch Conversion

This program was created to convert the older versions of Yosuga no Sora and Haruka na Sora based on the EntisGLS Engine to the newer format based on the KiriKiri Engine.

This entire process is detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/EnormousSpud/YnS-Wiki/wiki).

The English patch for Yosuga no Sora can be found in the English YNS [Discord](https://discord.gg/yosuga-no-sora).

Only raw scripts in Japanese is supported at the moment, XP3 pack and other languages are WIP.
